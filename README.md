# Audio to LLM Response


A real-time voice chatbot that captures user speech and responds with generated audio replies using a Large Language Model (LLM).

### Core Functionality
1.   **Record:** Captures audio from the user's microphone.
2.   **Transcribe:** Converts the audio to text using **Whisper**.
3.   **Generate:** Generates an intelligent response using **Cohere**.
4.   **Synthesize:** Converts the text response back to audio using **gTTS**.
5.   **Play:** Automatically plays the audio response to the user.

##  Setup and Installation Guide

Follow these steps carefully to set up the project environment.

### Step 1: System Prerequisites

Before installing the project libraries, ensure your system has the following:

-   **Python 3.8 or newer**: Verify your installation by running `python --version`.
-   **FFmpeg**: This is a critical dependency for audio processing.
    -   Download it from the [**official FFmpeg website**](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html ).
    -   Install it and ensure the executable's location is added to your system's `PATH` variable.

### Step 2: Project Files

Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

```bash
# Clone the repository using Git
git clone https://your-repository-url.git

# Navigate into the newly created project directory
cd your-project-directory
```
> *Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file and extract it manually.*

### Step 3: Install Python Libraries

Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt inside the project directory and run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-CORS openai-whisper cohere gTTS numpy scipy
```

### Step 4: Configure API Key

The chatbot relies on the Cohere API to generate responses.

1.  Go to [**cohere.com**](https://cohere.com ) and sign up for a free developer account.
2.  From your dashboard, generate a new **Trial API Key**.
3.  Open the `app.py` file in your code editor.
4.  Locate the line for the API key and paste your key as a string:

    ```python
    # Replace the placeholder with your actual key
    COHERE_API_KEY = "pAStE_yOuR_kEy_HeRe"  # ⚠️ Important: Do NOT share this key publicly!
    ```
5.  Save the `app.py` file.

##  Running the Application

Once all the setup and configuration steps are complete, you are ready to launch the chatbot.

1.  **Start the Server**: In your terminal (while inside the project directory), run the main Python script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  **Access the Application**: After the server starts, you will see a confirmation message. Open your web browser and navigate to:
    > ### **`http://127.0.0.1:5000`**
3.  **Grant Permissions**: The first time you click the microphone icon, your browser will prompt you for microphone access. **You must click "Allow"** for the application to work.
4.  **Start Talking**: Click the microphone icon and enjoy your conversation with the AI!
