# Audio to LLM Response
This project is a real-time voice chatbot that captures user speech and responds with generated audio replies using an LLM.
It works by:
1. Recording the user's voice.
2. Transcribing the audio to text using Whisper.
3. Generating a response using Cohere.
4. Converting the response to audio using gTTS.
5. Playing the audio response automatically.
